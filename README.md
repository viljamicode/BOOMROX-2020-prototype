# BOOMROX-2020-prototype
A prototype of a mobile game ("BOOMROX") I made in 2020 using C# and Unity.

For an example of C# code written by me, go into Assets\Scripts and look at "shoot.cs" or any of the other C# scripts in that folder.



THE GAME:

The idea was a 2D top-down game that combined elements of classic minigolf and Asteroids(the arcade game from 1979).

The game only has a few prototype levels and the gameplay loop is very basic: Try and get the player model("ship") to the finish in as few "shots" as possible. There are obstacles ("space rocks").

There is also an arcade level where the obstacles just spawn around you and you can hit them with your "ship" for fun. I made a working prototype of this game for Android, where you could play it on a touch screen. However, if you wish to turn it into an .exe file on your PC, you can play it with your mouse.

I learned quite a bit while making this prototype and I might continue working on this some day if I get some inspiration.






NOTE: Some project files (shaders etc) were not uploaded to GitHub, since this project was only uploaded to showcase some of my C# work.
